## How to Choose Your Favorite:

Browse through your site and see which heading font feels right. Once you decide:

1. Replace all instances of `font-heading-option-X` with your chosen option
2. Or use the same class for all headings for consistency

Example: If you like **Option 3 (Bricolage Grotesque)**, replace all instances:
- `font-heading-option-1` → `font-heading-option-3`
- `font-heading-option-2` → `font-heading-option-3`
- etc.

## My Recommendations:

- **Most versatile**: Option 1 (Space Grotesk) or Option 2 (Outfit)
- **Most distinctive**: Option 3 (Bricolage Grotesque) or Option 7 (Fraunces)
- **Most elegant**: Option 4 (Epilogue) or Option 6 (DM Serif Display)
- **Most modern/tech**: Option 5 (Sora)
