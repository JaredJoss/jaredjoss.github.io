  - Specialization: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Large Dimensional Data Processing.
- **BSc Electrical (Information) Engineering** (Distinction) | University of the Witwatersrand (2018-2021)
  - Top 5 in 3rd year; 1st place in 4th year (Entelect Prize).

## Work Experience
- **Senior AI Research Engineer @ Ufonia** (London, 2025-Present)
  - Developing LLM-based conversational systems for automated postoperative follow-up.
  - Benchmarking multilingual LLMs and improving evaluation pipelines for clinical safety.
- **Junior Data Scientist @ The Awareness Company** (South Africa, 2022-2023)
  - Built computer vision models for anti-poaching (identifying high-risk areas in Kafue National Park) and fine-tuned LLM chatbots using Azure OpenAI.

## Detailed Research & Publications

### Primary Research: LLM Safety & Healthcare

**1. Insights from the Inverse: Reconstructing LLM Training Goals Through Inverse Reinforcement Learning**
- **Venue:** COLM 2025
- **Tech Stack:** TRL, Hugging Face, Pythia (70M/410M), RLHF.
- **Key Findings:** Developed a max-margin Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm to extract reward models from fine-tuned LLMs.
  - The algorithm achieved **80.40% accuracy** in recovering the ground-truth objective.
  - Demonstrated that fine-tuning with the extracted IRL reward model resulted in **lower toxicity** than the original RLHF process.

**2. ASTRID — An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems**
- **Venue:** ACL 2025
- **Focus:** RAG Evaluation, Clinical QA, Reliability.
- **Summary:** A framework designed to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in clinical settings, focusing on safety, reliability, and scalability.
